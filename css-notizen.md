<h1>Css Notizen</h1>

* The basic anatomy of CSS syntax written for both inline styles and stylesheets.

* Some commonly used CSS terms, such as ruleset, selector, and declaration.

* CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.

* Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.

* An internal stylesheet is written using the <style> element inside the <head> element of an HTML file.

* Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.

* An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the “.css”.file extension.

* External stylesheets are the best approach when it comes to using HTML and CSS.

* External stylesheets are linked to HTML using the <link> element.

* CSS can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute.

* All elements can be selected using the universal selector.

* An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.

* Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.

* Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.

* IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a type selector.

* Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.

* Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.

* Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
